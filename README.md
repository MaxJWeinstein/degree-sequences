# Degree Sequences

This was a quick project inspired by [this YouTube video by TheChiptide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C3C_wa_mqQ). In it, he poses the problem, "How many ways can you arrange 13 nodes, such that they all have degree at least 2, 7 or more have degree at least 3, and none have degree greater than 4?"

There's no closed form for this, but it can be computed (especially with just 13 nodes). After a bit of Googling and coding, this is the result.

## Note

The problem in the video should really specify planar graphs. The script as of now does not guarantee that it's counting planar graphs.
